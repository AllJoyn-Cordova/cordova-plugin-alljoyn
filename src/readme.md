Early Concept for SRC Folder
----------------------------

/src/ajtcl 
is autogenerated by a script that pulls the alljoyn thin client library sources directly from git and dumps them here.

/src/<platform> 
will contain platform specific source files, these may be similar to the /targets/ files in the ajtcl source tree.  Will also contain the cordova shim layer.  Do whatever you want to here.
